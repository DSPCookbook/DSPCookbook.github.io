Our vision with The DSP Cookbook was to create a place on the internet where engineers, scientists, and alike quickly could access a vast number of commonly used algorithms that is applied in digital signal processing. From our own experiences, we felt that digital signal processing could sometimes get presented in an unstructured and confusing maner with a lack of coherency across litterature. As an example, DSP algorithms are often presented in a mixture of introduction, concept, derivation, proofs, properties, special cases, implementation, appliction, and examples which make the reading sometimes frustrating, in particular if you are only looking for something specific e.g. the implementation.

We came across the idea of creating a website where the DSP algorithms are presented in a manner similar to recipes found in a cookbook which we very much liked since the presentation of recipes in a cookbook are usually easy to follow and structured. Our hope is therefore that people will find the website, like us, usefull.



## The Team



The DSP Cookbook team consists of two chefs:
### Poul Hoang
Poul Hoang received his B.Sc. in Electronics Engineering in 2016 and later his M.Sc. in Signal Processing from the department of Electronic Systems Aalborg University in 2018. Poul Hoang is currently working towards his industrial Ph.D. degree in noise reduction for hearing assistive devices which is partly funded by Innovation Fund Denmark in collaboration with Demant A/S and Aalborg University. His research interests includes multichannel signal processing with application to speech and audio. 

### Rasmus Gundorff SÃ¦derup
Rasmus graduated as signal processing engineers from Aalborg University in 2018.
He has since worked as a signal processing research engineer at Viewcare A/S.
