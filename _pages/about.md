Our vision with The DSP Cookbook is to create a place on the web where engineers, scientists, and alike can quickly access a vast number of commonly used algorithms for digital signal processing. From our own experiences, we feel that digital signal processing can often get presented in an unstructured and confusing manner with a lack of coherency across the literature. As an example, DSP algorithms are often presented in a mixture of concepts, derivation, proofs, properties, special cases, implementation, applications and examples which makes the reading sometimes frustrating, in particular when you're just looking for a simple code-example to test out.

We came across the idea of creating a website where the DSP algorithms are presented in a manner similar to recipes found in a cookbook. Recipes found in cookbooks are usually presented in a easy to follow and clear manner making them simple to try out. Our hope is therefore that you will find this website useful and convenient to use as a look-up or "cheat sheet".


## The Team


The DSP Cookbook team consists of two chefs:
### Poul Hoang
Poul Hoang received his B.Sc. in Electronics Engineering in 2016 and later his M.Sc. in Signal Processing from the department of Electronic Systems Aalborg University in 2018. Poul Hoang is currently working towards his industrial Ph.D. degree in noise reduction for hearing assistive devices which is partly funded by Innovation Fund Denmark in collaboration with Demant A/S and Aalborg University. His research interests includes multichannel signal processing with application to speech and audio.

### Rasmus Gundorff Sæderup

Rasmus Gundorff Sæderup received his B.Sc. in Electronics Engineering in 2016 and graduated from Aalborg University in 2018 with a master's degree in Signal Processing.
He is currently working as a signal processing research engineer at Viewcare A/S, where he develops algorithms for biomedical applications as well as writing software for both embedded devices and PC applications. His research interests include signal processing for biomedical applications, communication systems, optimization methods and artificial intelligence.
