Our vision with The DSP Cookbook was to create a place on the web where engineers, scientists, and alike quickly could access a vast number of commonly used algorithms that is applied in digital signal processing. From our own experiences, we felt that digital signal processing could sometimes get presented in an unstructured and confusing manner with a lack of coherency across the litterature. As an example, DSP algorithms are often presented in a mixture of concepts, derivation, proofs, properties, special cases, implementation, applications, and examples which makes the reading sometimes frustrating, in particular when looking for something specific.

We came across the idea of creating a website where the DSP algorithms are presented in a manner similar to recipes found in a cookbook. Recipes found in cookbooks are usually presented in a easy to follow and clear manner making them simple to try out. Our hope is therefore that people will find the website, like us, usefull and convenient as a look-up or "cheat sheet".



## The Team



The DSP Cookbook team consists of two chefs:
### Poul Hoang
Poul Hoang received his B.Sc. in Electronics Engineering in 2016 and later his M.Sc. in Signal Processing from the department of Electronic Systems Aalborg University in 2018. Poul Hoang is currently working towards his industrial Ph.D. degree in noise reduction for hearing assistive devices which is partly funded by Innovation Fund Denmark in collaboration with Demant A/S and Aalborg University. His research interests includes multichannel signal processing with application to speech and audio. 

### Rasmus Gundorff SÃ¦derup
Rasmus graduated as signal processing engineers from Aalborg University in 2018.
He has since worked as a signal processing research engineer at Viewcare A/S.
